        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Welcome to learnfromscratch.online, a unique and interactive learning portal, where technology, creativity, and personal growth converge. Unlike traditional learning platforms, this site documents my own learning journey, showcasing real-time lessons, exercises, and their tangible outcomes. From coding projects materializing as cloud services to visual representations of 3D modeling exercises, each step of my journey is transparent and live for you to see and learn from. What sets this site apart is the dialogical approach to learning. As a student, I engage in continuous, in-depth conversations with my teacher, ChatGPT, an AI developed by OpenAI. This format offers a personalized, reflective, and highly engaging learning experience. You’re not just reading content; you’re witnessing an evolving dialogue of knowledge exchange. Whether you’re starting from scratch or looking to deepen your expertise, join us on this innovative learning adventure, where every challenge is an opportunity and every question a stepping stone to understanding.
