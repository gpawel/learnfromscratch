                        <li>Cross-platform Testing: If needed, ensure the platform supports testing across various environments and devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Selection Process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Assess Needs: Start by assessing the specific needs of your project.</li>
                <li>Research and Shortlist: Research available platforms and create a shortlist based on the criteria above.</li>
                <li>Proof of Concept: Implement a small proof of concept for the top choices to evaluate their fit.</li>
                <li>Gather Team Feedback: Involve the QA team in the selection process to gather insights and preferences.</li>
                <li>Make an Informed Decision: Combine the research, proof of concept results, and team feedback to make a decision.</li>
